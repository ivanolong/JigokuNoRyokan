Project Name:
Jigoku No Ryokan

Description:
This project was started as a way to advertise the game that my group has made in the Integrated Project. It is basically an extension of the game and a way for players to download the game and other features that will be explained below.

Design Process:
The design process is just based on the genre of the game that we are making which is horror, thus we have the dull and dark/dim colour scheme to fit it. The website is focused on the games' players as well as anyone who is interested in playing the game. The website will allow users to download the game, interact on the blog and check out the team(my team) that made the game. This is made possible with the easy to use navigation bar as well as the content in the separate pages.
As a user that wants to interact with others, they can just click the navigation bar's blog and scroll through the content or post something.
As a user that wants to download the game, simply just click the navigation bar's download and download the game.
As a user that wants to learn some tips about the game. click the navigation bar's tips and tricks and read some tips.
As a user that wants to check out the team that made the game, just click the navigation bar's about us and read through.

Features:
Feature 1 - The login page is just the simple login page for users to put in their credentials and log into the website
Feature 2 - The blog is a place where users can post what they have in mind or for them to interact with one another and also for the game developers to release patch notes and updates for the game.
Feature 3 - The download page is just a simple download page, pretty self explanatory. Has a trailer for you to watch.
Feature 4 - The tips and tricks page is a page where users can just collapse the information down to read.
Feature 5 - The about us page is a simple page where users can just read through the team.

Future Features can be a section where users can learn about the different types of ghosts in the game and maybe a page for users to buy merch for the game.
